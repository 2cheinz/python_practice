# python_practice

This repository is a collection of my practice examples and exercises of Python3 through Colt Steele's Modern Python Bootcamp to prepare for CS 162 at Oregon State. I have experience with Python through CS 161 in the Oregon State Computer Science and now I am using those skills to stay sharp and refresh myself for upcoming course.
